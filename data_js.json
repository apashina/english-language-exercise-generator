carrying under your apron?","497":"Grandmother is sick and weak, and I am taking her some cake and wine.","498":"Little Red Cap, just where does your grandmother live?","499":"Her house is a good quarter hour from here in the woods, under the three large oak trees.","500":"There is a hedge of hazel bushes there.","501":"The wolf thought to himself, Now there is a tasty bite for me.","502":"Just how are you going to catch her?","503":"Then he said, Listen, Little Red Cap, have not you seen the beautiful flowers that are blossoming in the woods?","504":"Why do not you go and take a look?","505":"And I do not believe you can hear how beautifully the birds are singing.","506":"You are walking along as though you were on your way to school in the village.","507":"It is very beautiful in the woods.","508":"Little Red Cap opened her eyes and saw the sunlight breaking through the trees and how the ground was covered with beautiful flowers.","509":"She thought, If a take a bouquet to grandmother, she will be very pleased.","510":"Anyway, it is still early, and I will be home on time.","511":"And she ran off into the woods looking for flowers.","512":"Each time she picked one she thought that she could see an even more beautiful one a little way off, and she ran after it, going further and further into the woods.","513":"But the wolf ran straight to the grandmother's house and knocked on the door.","514":"Who is there?","515":"I am bringing you some cake and wine.","516":"Open the door for me.","517":"Just press the latch, called out the grandmother.","518":"I am too weak to get up.","519":"The wolf pressed the latch, and the door opened.","520":"He stepped inside, went straight to the grandmother's bed, and ate her up.","521":"Then he took her clothes, put them on, and put her cap on his head.","522":"He got into her bed and pulled the curtains shut.","523":"Little Red Cap had run after flowers, and did not continue on her way to grandmother's until she had gathered all that she could carry.","524":"When she arrived, she found, to her surprise, that the door was open.","525":"She walked into the parlor, and everything looked so strange that she thought, Oh, my God, why am I so afraid?","526":"I usually like it at grandmother's.","527":"Then she went to the bed and pulled back the curtains.","528":"Grandmother was lying there with her cap pulled down over her face and looking very strange.","529":"Oh, grandmother, what big ears you have!","530":"All the better to hear you with.","531":"Oh, grandmother, what big eyes you have!","532":"All the better to see you with.","533":"Oh, grandmother, what big hands you have!","534":"All the better to grab you with!","535":"Oh, grandmother, what a horribly big mouth you have!","536":"All the better to eat you with!","537":"And with that he jumped out of bed, jumped on top of poor Little Red Cap, and ate her up.","538":"As soon as the wolf had finished this tasty bite, he climbed back into bed, fell asleep, and began to snore very loudly.","539":"A huntsman was just passing by.","540":"He thought it strange that the old woman was snoring so loudly, so he decided to take a look.","541":"He stepped inside, and in the bed there lay the wolf that he had been hunting for such a long time.","542":"He has eaten the grandmother, but perhaps she still can be saved.","543":"I will not shoot him, thought the huntsman.","544":"So he took a pair of scissors and cut open his belly.","545":"He had cut only a few strokes when he saw the red cap shining through.","546":"He cut a little more, and the girl jumped out and cried, Oh, I was so frightened!","547":"It was so dark inside the wolf's body!","548":"And then the grandmother came out alive as well.","549":"Then Little Red Cap fetched some large heavy stones.","550":"They filled the wolf's body with them, and when he woke up and tried to run away, the stones were so heavy that he fell down dead.","551":"The three of them were happy.","552":"The huntsman took the wolf's pelt.","553":"The grandmother ate the cake and drank the wine that Little Red Cap had brought.","554":"And Little Red Cap thought to herself, As long as I live, I will never leave the path and run off into the woods by myself if mother tells me not to.","555":"They also tell how Little Red Cap was taking some baked things to her grandmother another time, when another wolf spoke to her and wanted her to leave the path.","556":"But Little Red Cap took care and went straight to grandmother's.","557":"She told her that she had seen the wolf, and that he had wished her a good day, but had stared at her in a wicked manner.","558":"Come, said the grandmother.","559":"Soon afterward the wolf knocked on the door and called out, Open up, grandmother.","560":"It is Little Red Cap, and I am bringing you some baked things.","561":"They remained silent, and did not open the door.","562":"The wicked one walked around the house several times, and finally jumped onto the roof.","563":"He wanted to wait until Little Red Cap went home that evening, then follow her and eat her up in the darkness.","564":"But the grandmother saw what he was up to.","565":"There was a large stone trough in front of the house.","566":"Fetch a bucket, Little Red Cap, she said.","567":"Yesterday I cooked some sausage.","568":"Carry the water that I boiled them with to the trough.","569":"Little Red Cap carried water until the large, large trough was clear full.","570":"The smell of sausage arose into the wolf's nose.","571":"He sniffed and looked down, stretching his neck so long that he could no longer hold himself, and he began to slide.","572":"He slid off the roof, fell into the trough, and drowned.","573":"And Little Red Cap returned home happily and safely.","574":"Translated by D.
